Thats not even the main game, there is of course the one and only Trophy Road and it is a really fun 1 v 1 mode and every time you win you climb up in the ranks.

This will ensure the remaining teammate doesn’t feel disadvantaged or regretful, and the match can continue smoothly. 👉 After every 2 vs 2 match, a “Player of the Match” highlight should be displayed immediately, so that out of the four players, everyone can see who delivered the best.",

Now one thing I would like to say is that when I call this game challenging were talking I won't leave this game until I get to the next arena type challenging but in a fun way to. Each and every card is different from the last but some cards pair good with each other like when you get hog rider you can put the hog behind the mini Pekka to help him get to the tower faster. This an amazing game",

BUT supercell made progression a bit easier for free to play players by adding a seasonal challenge which thus season for example gives you a hero at arena 15 ! And the game is a bit addicting but it also takes skill with some decks and strategy. So, in conclusion im giving it a 4 star since its a good game actually but still not very good enough for 5 make it better!",

Can you finally change the way draws are chosen for who wins? it should be total damage dealt to all towers. It makes no sense how it is now.

To get lvl.15s is hard and I can say that you get it faster when you buy the wild cards because of my friend that plays a fully maxed out lvl.15 deck in Dragons spa. All I'm saying is that the game is not pay to win completely although spending money can help you progress faster the other players.",

The core gameplay loop of building a village, training troops, and attacking others for resources is simple to understand yet offers surprising strategic depth, particularly at higher town hall levels and in competitive modes like Clan Wars and Clan War Leagues.

I open the game and hear that beautiful jingle, I see the loading screen and then.... an angelic delight. One time Clash was down and I had a panic attack, I started shaking. hope this helps. 🥰",
